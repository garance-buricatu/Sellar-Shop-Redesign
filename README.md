### Client: Bonnie Frederico - an artist from Massachusetts looking to redesign her website

### Project Links:


### About the Project
* A web application designed entirely from scratch, using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React/Redux, NodeJS)
* Used Postman to test API routes before integrating them on the frontend

### Two parts:
1) Public pages to display the artist's work and more information
2) Private pages (the dashboard) which can be accessed from the "Contact" tab
- The dashboard requires authentication to access and allows the user to add, delete, and edit the content that is displayed on the public pages

### To Start from cloned repository
Open terminal and run "npm run dev"
